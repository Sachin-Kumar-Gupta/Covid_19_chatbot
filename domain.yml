  utter_spreading_of_covid:
  - text: |
      The coronavirus spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets tiny drops of mucus that spray into the air when we cough or sneeze.
      A cough or sneeze can also send the virus up to 6 feet away.
      That’s why we recommend keeping at least 6 feet between you and anyone else and always wear a mask in public to decrease the risk of spread.

  utter_vitamins:
  - text: |
      A balanced diet that includes vitamin A, B, C, D, E, and K, and micronutrients such as sodium, zinc, potassium, chloride, calcium, and phosphorus may help maintain general wellbeing and strengthen the immune system, thus decreasing infections.
      A deficiency of vitamins and minerals in the plasma leads to sub-par performance of the immune system, leading to a poor immune state.

  utter_sanitizer:
  - text: |
      Hand sanitizers can  protect against disease-causing microbes, especially in situations when soap and water are not available.
      They’re also proven to be effective in reducing the number and type of microbes. Usage of sanitizer is suggestable.
      It is advisable to use alcohol based sanitizer."

  utter_about_mask:
  - text: |
      Everyone 2 years or older who is not fully vaccinated should wear a mask in indoor public places.
      Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth is required.
      Consider wearing a mask in crowded outdoor settings and for activities with close contact with others.

  utter_about_vaccine:
  - text: |
     "Two vaccines were granted emergency use authorization by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in India.
      Covishield® (AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin® (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited)."

  utter_children_mask_condition:
  - text: |
      Children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks. 
      This is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance.
      WHO and UNICEF advise that the decision to use masks for children aged 6-11 should be based on the following factors -
      
      1. Whether there is widespread transmission in the area where the child resides
      2. The ability of the child to safely and appropriately use a mask
      3. Access to masks, as well as laundering and replacement of masks in certain settings (such as schools and childcare services)
      4. Adequate adult supervision and instructions to the child on how to put on, take off and safely wear masks
      5. Potential impact of wearing a mask on learning and psychosocial development, in consultation with teachers, parents/caregivers and/or medical providers
      6. Specific settings and interactions the child has with other people who are at high risk of developing serious illness, such as the elderly and those with other underlying health conditions
      
      WHO and UNICEF advise that children aged 12 and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a 1-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area.

      In general, children aged 5 years and under should not be required to wear masks.
      This advice is based on the safety and overall interest of the child and the capacity to appropriately use a mask with minimal assistance.
      There may be local requirements for children aged 5 years and under to wear masks, or specific needs in some settings, such as being physically close to someone who is ill. 
      In these circumstances, if the child wears a mask, a parent or other guardian should be within direct line of sight to supervise the safe use of the mask.

  utter_children_health_condition:
  - text: |
     "Children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis or cancer should wear a medical mask in consultation with their medical providers. A medical mask provides protection to the person wearing the mask and prevents transmission to others. It is recommended for anyone who has underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk of serious illness."
  
  utter_children_mask_type:
  - text: |
      Children who are in general good health can wear a non-medical or fabric mask. 
      This provides source control, meaning it keeps the virus from being transmitted to others if they are infected and are not aware that they are infected. 
      The adult who is providing the mask should ensure the fabric mask is the correct size and sufficiently covers the nose, mouth and chin of the child. 
      Children with underlying health conditions such as cystic fibrosis, cancer or immunosuppression, should, in consultation with their medical providers, wear a medical mask. 
      A medical mask controls spreading of the virus and protection to the wearer, and is recommended for anyone who is at higher risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19.

  utter_children_mask_at_home:
  - text: |
      Any child who has symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should wear a medical mask, as long as they can tolerate it. 
      The child should be isolated, and medical advice sought as soon as they start to feel unwell, even if symptoms are mild. 
      Family members/caregivers who come within 1 metre of the sick child at home should also wear a mask. 
      A household member who is sick or has tested positive with the virus that causes COVID-19 should be isolated from everyone else if possible. 
      If the child comes within 1 metre of the sick person at home, the adult and child should wear a medical mask during that time.

  utter_children_mask_when_playing:
  - text: |
      Children should not wear a mask when playing sports or doing physical activities, such as running, jumping or playing on the playground, so that it doesn’t compromise their breathing. 
      When organizing these activities for children, it is important to encourage all other critical public health measures, maintaining at least a 1-metre distance from others, limiting the number of children playing together, providing access to hand hygiene facilities and encouraging their use.

  utter_children_mask_alternative:
  - text: |
      In the context of COVID-19, some children may not be able to wear a mask due to disabilities or specific situations such as speech classes where the teacher needs to see their mouths. 
      In these cases, face shields may be considered an alternative to masks, but they do not provide the equivalent protection in keeping the virus from being transmitted to others. 
      If a decision is made to use a face shield, it should cover the entire face, wrap around the sides of the face and extend to below the chin. 
      Caution should be taken while wearing one to avoid injuries that could break it and harm the eyes or face.

  utter_testing:
  - text: "Covid-19 testing can identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus (virus responsible for COVID-19) and includes methods that detect the presence of virus itself (RT-PCR and isothermal nucleic acid amplification) and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection"
  - text: "COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your medical provider first. You can also visit your state or health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested."
